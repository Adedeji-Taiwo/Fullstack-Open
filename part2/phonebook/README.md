# Phonebook

Let's create a simple phonebook. In this part we will only be adding names to the phonebook.

## Steps
* Step 1: Let us start by implementing the addition of a person to phonebook.
* Step 2: Prevent the user from being able to add names that already exist in the phonebook. 
* Step 3: Expand your application by allowing users to add phone numbers to the phone book. You
* Step 4: Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name.
* Step 5: If you have implemented your application in a single component, refactor it by extracting suitable parts into new components.
* Step 6: Store the initial state of the application in the file db.json, which should be placed in the root of the project. Modify the application such that the initial state of the data is fetched from the server using the axios-library. Complete the fetching with an Effect hook.

```
