# Data for Countries

The API https://restcountries.com provides data for different countries in a machine-readable format, a so-called REST API.

Create an application, in which one can look at data of various countries. The application should probably get the data from the endpoint all.



## Steps

- Step 1: The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field. If there are too many (over 10) countries that match the query, then the user is prompted to make their query more specific.
- Step 2: Show also the sum of the exercises of the course.
- Step 3: Calculate the sum of exercises with the array method reduce.
- Step 4: Extend our application to allow for an arbitrary number of courses.
- Step 5: Declare the Course component as a separate module, which is imported by the App component.


## Start the Application

To start an application, do the following :

```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Start the application
$ npm start
```
Application can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/](localhost)
