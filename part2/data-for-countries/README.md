# Data for Countries

The API https://restcountries.com provides data for different countries in a machine-readable format, a so-called REST API.

Create an application, in which one can look at data of various countries. The application should probably get the data from the endpoint all.



## Steps

- Step 1: The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field. If there are too many (over 10) countries that match the query, then the user is prompted to make their query more specific.
- Step 2: Improve on the application in the previous exercise, such that when the names of multiple countries are shown on the page there is a button next to the name of the country, which when pressed shows the view for that country.
- Step 3: Add to the view showing the data of a single country, the weather report for the capital of that country.



## Start the Application

To start an application, do the following :

```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Start the application
$ npm start
```
Application can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/](localhost)
