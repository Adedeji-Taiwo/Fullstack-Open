# Unicafe

Like most companies, Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

The application displays statistics about the gathered feedback in an HTML table: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.

## Start the Application

To start an application, do the following :

```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Start the application
$ npm start
```
Application can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/](localhost)
